From game development to web applications \\\\nand even Linux apps written in C++ or .NET, Visual \\\\nStudio continues to be the IDE of choice for developers \\\\nworking on Windows. Visual Studio Code is one of \\\\nthe most popular editors for developers working on \\\\nany operating system and building apps with any \\\\nprogramming language or framework.\\\\nVisual Studio\\\\nVisual Studio is an integrated, full-featured \\\\ndevelopment environment providing teams \\\\nand individuals with the end-to-end toolset for \\\\ndevelopment, testing, debugging, and deployment. \\\\nVisual Studio offers a set of innovative and intelligent \\\\nfeatures that allows individual developers and entire \\\\nteams alike to be more productive. IntelliSense and \\\\nIntelliCode bring smarter code completion into the \\\\nIDE and simplify repetitive tasks like refactoring. \\\\nDiagnostics and debugging features, such as Snapshot \\\\nDebugging and live integration with Azure Application \\\\nInsights, offer full visibility into your app's execution \\\\nhistory and debug state wherever it runs. Built-\\\\nin Git and GitHub integration allows for seamless \\\\ncollaboration: developers can create and clone repos, \\\\nmanage branches, and resolve merge conflicts right \\\\ninside the IDE. Visual Studio Live Share lets developers \\\\ncollaborate in their IDE in real time by setting up a \\\\nshared network session, allowing participants to edit \\\\nand work together as if they were sitting side by side. \\\\nWhether developers want to deploy their app locally, to \\\\ntheir own servers, or to Azure, Visual Studio makes the \\\\nprocess consistent and easy to set up. Deployment to \\\\nAzure can be configured from within the IDE, regardless \\\\nof whether it's published directly, via FTP, through a \\\\nCI/CD pipeline, to Azure PaaS services, or through a \\\\nDocker/Kubernetes container configuration. \\\\nVisual Studio for Mac\\\\nVisual Studio for Mac is a full-featured IDE for \\\\ndevelopers on macOS who build applications, games, \\\\nand services for iOS, Android, macOS, the cloud, and \\\\nthe web. Modern technologies and frameworks like \\\\n.NET, Unity, C#, and F# enable you to rapidly innovate \\\\nwith a world-class IDE.
