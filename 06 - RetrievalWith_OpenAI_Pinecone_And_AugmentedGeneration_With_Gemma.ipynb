Units in populous cities are large and well-equipped, while those in agricultural villages may be just a few women with small arms. There is no uniform, everyone wears what they like. However, the Asari army is not an irregular militia after all, and those who serve are full-time professionals.\\\\n\\\\nThe average age of an Asari Hunter is that she is in the maiden stage and has spent about 20 or 30 years studying martial arts. Asari choose to be warriors at a young age, and their education from that moment on is dedicated to sharpening their body and mind for a single purpose. When they retire, they have an alarming mastery of the art of killing.\\\\n\\\\nHunters fight individually or in pairs, depending on the preferred tactics in their city. One by one, the hunters are virtually unbeatable, possessing deep tactical vision, a hunter's eye, and the grace and alacrity of a dancer. Biotics is common enough that some ability is required as a requirement to be trained as a hunter; Lack of biotic talent excludes a young Asari from military service.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough fluid and mobile, the Asari cannot stand in the face of a storm of enemy fire the way a krogan, turian, or human could. Due to the small size of their units and the fact that they usually lack heavy armor and supporting weapons, they are almost incapable of fighting a conventional war, especially one of a defensive nature. Therefore, Asari units normally carry out special operations missions. Like an army of ninjas, they are experts in ambushing, infiltrating and assassinating, demoralizing and defeating their enemies through intense guerrilla warfare. Asari huntresses were among the first individuals to be chosen as wraiths and played a key role in the krogan rebellions.\\\\n\\\\nAs a popular Turian saying goes: \\\\\\\"The Asari are the greatest warriors in the galaxy. Fortunately, there are not many of them.\\\\\\\"\\\\nNotable units include: Second Fleet, Sixth Fleet, Serrice Guard, Armali Sniper Unit, Asari Commandos.\\\\n\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"chunk\\\": 1, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nBiology\\\\nLauna T'Saphra mentioning to Isa of Navar the use of pronouns and genders in the asari. A typical Asari individual has a bluish-purple complexion. Some Asari may also feature a blue-green color, but this appears to be a rarity. They may present facial marks (similar to tattoos), it seems that they may be of genetic origin, depending on the race of the father. Instead of hair on their heads, Asari have wavy folds of sculpted skin. Aside from this and their skin tone, aesthetically the Asari are the species most similar to human beings. The Asari have a robust cell regeneration system. While they do not heal faster than other species, Asari can reach 1,000 years of age.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Asari have only one sex, they are not asexual. An Asari provides two copies of her own genes to her offspring, which regardless of the species or sex of the individual they reproduce with, the result is always an Asari. The process of reproduction is known as \\\\u201cfusion,\\\\u201d also known as \\\\u201cunion.\\\\u201d During the fusion, an Asari harmonizes her nervous system with that of her partner, sending and receiving electrical impulses directly through the skin. The Asari and her partner briefly become one, once the nervous system is unified.\\\\n\\\\nThis unique reproduction process is the reason why the Asari have great biotic talent. Your ability to consciously control nerve impulses is very similar to biotic training. The companion can be another Asari, or another individual of any species. Since the Asari began to encounter other intelligent species, their non-Asari companions have become preferred, due to the diversity they offer.\\\\n\\\\nThis reproductive process can lead to some confusion among non-Asari, who may expect offspring to be a mix of genes. However, the offspring are always 100% Asari, as they do not actually take DNA from the couple, they simply use it as a \\\\u201cmap\\\\u201d to randomly select the genes (always Asari genes) of the offspring.\\\\n\\\\nThe Asari go through 3 stages of life, marked by biochemical changes and physiologies:\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\u201cMaiden\\\\u201d stage begins at puberty and is characterized by the impulse to explore and experiment. Most young Asaris are curious and restless.\\\\nThe \\\\u201cMidwife\\\\u201d stage begins at the age of 350, although it can occur earlier if the Asari melts frequently. This period is marked by the desire to settle in an area and raise their daughters.\\\\nThe \\\\u201cMatriarch\\\\u201d stage begins at around 700 years of age, or later if the individual melts on rare occasions. Matriarchs actively participate in their community as wise advisors, offering the wisdom of centuries of experience. Matriarchs are rarely seen outside of Asari space.\\\\n\\\\nIt should be noted that each stage can begin when an Asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity. Additionally, there may be cases where maidens prefer to stay close to home rather than explore, matrons prefer work to building a family, and matriarchs have no interest in community affairs.\\\\n\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"chunk\\\": 5, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\nECONOMY\\\\nThe asari have the largest single economy in the entire galaxy. They have a large commercial volume and social contacts. Craft guilds, such as those in the cities of Serrice and Armali, maintain a virtual monopoly on advanced biotic technology. Considering their political influence, an embargo by the Asari could be disastrous for the Alliance.\\\\n\\\"}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
